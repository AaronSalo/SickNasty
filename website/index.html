					<div class = "header">THE VISION</div>
					<div>
						<p>SickNasty is an online community platform that will allow users to create and share content (pictures, videos, or text) to their own personal page, or a specific community group.</p>
						<p>The goal is to provide a platform where users can communicate their interests. Users can “follow” a community or individual users to see the content that they share within the app. This will allow them to see content from people and communities they like, and things they aren’t interested won’t show up unless they search for it. People will also be able to share images, videos to either their own personal page or to a community in the app. The users who are a part of the community will be able to see the content that is shared on the community’s personal page.</p>
						<p>Users will also be able to create a community group, based on any topic they desire, where any other user can join and share content. Furthermore, SickNasty can also help people get answers to specific questions by asking them in a community related to those questions. It also gives other users that are knowledgeable in that specific topic the ability to engage in a discussion and work towards the root of the problem.</p>

					<div class = "header">WHY US</div>
					<div>
						<p>If you ever want to belong to a group and/or meet new people who are into the same things as you, join SickNasty. You can surf through communities and find the ones that stick out to you. Learn more about certain topics or join and help others get into the things you love. SickNasty can open up a brand new world to things you never knew about, obtain new hobbies and skills you can use for the rest of your life. SickNasty will help you make new life long friends.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div class = "header">WAIT, FOR WHO?</div>
					<div>
						<p>SickNasty is meant to be used by people who want to join communities and meet new people through their hobbies. Users can find inspiration, get new ideas from like-minded people, or just use it to kill time. We want to draw in creative people by giving them a space to flourish, people who want to learn by asking questions, and those looking for others to socialize with. We aspire to provide a space for users who want to share their content for others to enjoy.</p>

					<p>Our group started the ground running, we were doing everything great from iteration 0-1. We knew what we wanted and were accomplishing that. Everyone was giving input on what the app should do, its overall scope, the interesting features it could have and which features should be prioritized. When we first started coding the project, there were a couple hiccups with getting comfortable using git repositories. But members of the group who were experienced helped those who were having trouble. Ending off iteration 1 on a high note.  But we also had rough patches through development, mainly around iteration 2. This mainly dealt with cramming a lot at the end of the iteration because everyone wasn’t able to finish what they were assigned and some people had to pick up on the slack of others. Also the quality of the code was not up to the standard it should have been at. The code smells were plentiful. All these things were discussed and dealt with in the retrospective the group had for iteration 2. We laid out all of our problems and decided the correct response to fix these problems and improve on our shortcomings. We followed the plans for improvements and it has worked. We are using better coding practices. And are finishing the project without there being much cramming needed. And everyone is playing their part to finish out the project strong.</p>
					<p>At the beginning of the course we thought we were making something that people would actually be able to use, something that we could actually put out into the world through the playstore and see what people thought of it.  something that could have a heap load of features that all connected to the theme of people interacting with each other and forming new friends/communities. We fell through on one of the main things of the app, which was interacting with other people, which was at the core of its vision. But we were not able to connect to the internet due to restrictions. But everything else that we had thought of from the beginning came to fruition. We made several features that people could use to interact with others using the medium. We made it so users could look at/create communities, features that allowed users to follow other users if they were interested in what they had to say and even message these other users to get to know them better. We made it so users could post about their lives and give appreciation and/or criticism to other peoples posts through the comments on each post.</p>
					<p>If we were to start the entire app over with the knowledge we have now, it would be much smoother, and the technical hurdles that we have already solved. We could skip all the small annoying things  like small technical bugs that took far too long to fix because we didn't have enough knowledge on the things we were using (Mockito, espresso), or learning how to use android studio and becoming comfortable with it. We could move straight to getting the app running and being more meticulous about the UI, and maybe even have people try it out and change things based on their feedback. It would have made the group members work more efficiently as well, now at the end of the project we know who's good at doing what. And we can assign them that thing at the beginning of development, making it so everyone is comfortable with what they’re doing, which entails making the entire project have more quality in both the coding side of things, and the way it is structured.</p>
					<p>We can conclude at the end of our group's development that we all gained from this project. Things like how to properly communicate in a group environment and  be clear on the vision that the group is going for. Making sure everyone is on board. While working through our problems, we learned to encourage questions and discuss them further so they would not arise again. We are all looking forward to the next project each of us are a part of, so we can use this newly gained experience for what it's worth.</p>
