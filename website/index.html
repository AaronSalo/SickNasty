					<p>Our group started the ground running, we were doing everything great from iteration 0-1. We knew what we wanted and were accomplishing that. Everyone was giving input on what the app should do, its overall scope, the interesting features it could have and which features should be prioritized. When we first started coding the project, there were a couple hiccups with getting comfortable using git repositories. But members of the group who were experienced helped those who were having trouble. Ending off iteration 1 on a high note.  But we also had rough patches through development, mainly around iteration 2. This mainly dealt with cramming a lot at the end of the iteration because everyone wasn’t able to finish what they were assigned and some people had to pick up on the slack of others. Also the quality of the code was not up to the standard it should have been at. The code smells were plentiful. All these things were discussed and dealt with in the retrospective the group had for iteration 2. We laid out all of our problems and decided the correct response to fix these problems and improve on our shortcomings. We followed the plans for improvements and it has worked. We are using better coding practices. And are finishing the project without there being much cramming needed. And everyone is playing their part to finish out the project strong.</p>
					<p>At the beginning of the course we thought we were making something that people would actually be able to use, something that we could actually put out into the world through the playstore and see what people thought of it.  something that could have a heap load of features that all connected to the theme of people interacting with each other and forming new friends/communities. We fell through on one of the main things of the app, which was interacting with other people, which was at the core of its vision. But we were not able to connect to the internet due to restrictions. But everything else that we had thought of from the beginning came to fruition. We made several features that people could use to interact with others using the medium. We made it so users could look at/create communities, features that allowed users to follow other users if they were interested in what they had to say and even message these other users to get to know them better. We made it so users could post about their lives and give appreciation and/or criticism to other peoples posts through the comments on each post.</p>
					<p>If we were to start the entire app over with the knowledge we have now, it would be much smoother, and the technical hurdles that we have already solved. We could skip all the small annoying things  like small technical bugs that took far too long to fix because we didn't have enough knowledge on the things we were using (Mockito, espresso), or learning how to use android studio and becoming comfortable with it. We could move straight to getting the app running and being more meticulous about the UI, and maybe even have people try it out and change things based on their feedback. It would have made the group members work more efficiently as well, now at the end of the project we know who's good at doing what. And we can assign them that thing at the beginning of development, making it so everyone is comfortable with what they’re doing, which entails making the entire project have more quality in both the coding side of things, and the way it is structured.</p>
					<p>We can conclude at the end of our group's development that we all gained from this project. Things like how to properly communicate in a group environment and  be clear on the vision that the group is going for. Making sure everyone is on board. While working through our problems, we learned to encourage questions and discuss them further so they would not arise again. We are all looking forward to the next project each of us are a part of, so we can use this newly gained experience for what it's worth.</p>
