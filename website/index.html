					<div class = "header">THE VISION</div>
					<div>
						<p>SickNasty is an online community platform that will allow users to create and share content (pictures, or text) to their own personal page, or a specific community group.</p>
						<p>The goal is to provide a platform where users can communicate their interests. Users can “follow” a community or individual users to see the content that they share within the app. This will allow them to see content from people and communities they like, and things they aren’t interested in won’t show up unless they search for it. People will also be able to share images, or text to either their own personal page or to a community in the app. The users who are a part of the community will be able to see the content that is shared on the community’s main page.</p>
						<p>SickNasty can help people get answers to specific questions by asking them in a community related to those questions. It also gives other users that are knowledgeable in that specific topic the ability to engage in a discussion and work towards the root of the problem.</p>

					<div class = "header">WHY US</div>
					<div>
						<p>If you ever want to belong to a group or meet new people who are into the same things as you, join SickNasty. You can surf through communities and find the ones that stick out to you. Learn more about certain topics or join and help others get into the things you love. SickNasty can open up a brand new world to things you never knew about, obtain new hobbies and skills you can use for the rest of your life. SickNasty is there to help you make new life long friends.</p>

					<div class = "header">WAIT, FOR WHO?</div>
					<div>
						<p>SickNasty is meant to be used by people who want to join communities and meet new people through their hobbies. Users can find inspiration, get new ideas from like-minded people, or just use it to kill time. We want to draw in creative people by giving them a space to flourish, people who want to learn by asking questions, and those looking for others to socialize with. We aspire to provide a space for users who want to share their content for others to enjoy.</p>

					<p>Our group started off strong, we were doing everything great for Iterations 0 and 1. We knew what we wanted to do and had accomplished exactly that. Everyone was giving input on what the app should do, its overall scope and the interesting features it could have and their development priorities. When we first started programming, there were a couple hiccups with getting comfortable using git repositories. Members of the group who were experienced helped those who were having trouble. This ended Iteration 1 off with a high note. However with the success of previous iterations, we also had rough patches in other development iterations, mainly around Iteration 2. This consisted of cramming a lot of programming at the end of the iteration because not everyone was able to finish what they were assigned, with others picking up some of the slack. As a result, the quality of the code was not up to the standard it should have been at. The code smells were far too plentiful for our liking. All of these issues were discussed and dealt with in the retrospective the group had for Iteration 2. We laid out all of our problems and decided the correct response to fix these problems and improve on our shortcomings. We followed the plans for improvements and it has worked. Our code style is a lot more consistent with the rest of the project and the timeline all the way up to the deadline has been smooth.</p>
					<p>At the beginning of the course we thought we were making something that people would actually be able to use, something that we could put out into the world. We fell through on one of the main ideas of the app which was interacting with other people. This idea was at the core of our vision, but we were not able to connect to external resources due to restrictions placed upon the project. Downfall aside, everything else that we had thought of from the beginning came to fruition. We designed several features that people could use to interact with others.  Users are able to view other profiles and community pages, create posts to said pages and even message other users on the platform.</p>
					<p>If we were to start the entire app over with the knowledge we have now, it would be much smoother, and the technical hurdles that we have already solved wouldn't be a problem at all. We could skip all the annoyances such as those related to third party utilities (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso) or the usage of Android Studio. We could move straight to getting the app running and being more meticulous about the UI, and even incorporate some user centered design ideas. It would have led to better task assignments, now at the end of the project we know who's good at doing what. We would assign each developer at the beginning of development with tasks they are the strongest at, making it so everyone is comfortable with what they’re doing. This results in the entire project having more quality in both the coding side of things and the way it is structured.</p>
					<p>We can conclude at the end of our group's development that we all gained from this project, in one way or another. Things like how to properly communicate in a group environment and be clear on the vision that the group is going for. Making sure everyone is on board. While working through our problems, we learned to encourage questions and discuss them further so they would not arise again. We are all looking forward to the next project each of us are a part of, so we can use this newly gained experience for what it's worth.</p>

					<div>
						<div>Lucas Huynh</div>
						<div>Developed proper git etiquette with respect to merge requests and developing on seperate branches. Also learned a whole lot about reverting changes and solving merge conflicts.</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>Jay Khakhariya</div>
						<div>I learned several things from this project, from working in a group to developing in Android studio. One of the most important being how important tests are in a project this large. TDD also surprised me on how well it worked at times for me.</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>Jai Sandhu</div>
						<div>Throughout this whole progress, I learned how to write code in a group. Not working on the entire project, but specializing on specific parts and knowing that the other features will be taken care of.</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>Aaron Salo</div>
						<div>The main thing I learned was how to properly collaborate as a group on a programming project. Learning git and working through the various problems that arose while using it was a very meaningful experience. I also learned a lot about working in Android Studio, specifically with the UI portion.</div>

						<div>Jinkun Zhao</div>
						<div>Through this project, I learned how to develop and complete a project together in a team. Each team member has their own task to complete, then resolve the conflict to merge as a whole.</div>
